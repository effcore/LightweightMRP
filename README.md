# Easy Approach for a Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
## Description
Most Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions offer some kind of algorithm for calculating material requirements that need to be procured again. In this post I would like to show a hands-on approach written in C# for calculating the material requirements for multi-level items - so items, that will be assembled out of other components. Therefor, we need to break down the BOM and multiply itâ€™s demand to the lower levels. This can be done with the help of a more or less complex matrix (two-dimensional array) and a simple vector (one-dimensional array).

The following steps will be made:
* Build some demo-data
    * eleven items are created with the help of a struct
    * some of them contains a bill of material (BOM)
    * three of them got a demand
* Build the demand-matrix
* Build a unit-matrix
* Invert and normalize the demand-matrix
* Multiply the demand-matrix with the demand-vector to get the total demands
